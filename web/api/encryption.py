🔒 WHAT HAPPENS:
   - Your secret number is ENCRYPTED
   - Only the HASH is shared (proves commitment exists)
   - The opponent CANNOT see your number yet

💡 WHY IT MATTERS:
   - In Arcium: Data stays encrypted during processing
   - Trust is built on cryptographic proof, not transparency
   - You can prove you knew something without revealing it

🎮 IN THIS GAME:
   - You commit to your number
   - Opponent sees only the hash
   - Your number is mathematically locked in

   - Timestamp proves when it was committed

💡 WHY IT MATTERS:
   - In Arcium: Data is revealed only to authorized parties
   - The reveal is VERIFIABLE (can't have changed)
   - You're proven honest retroactively

🎮 IN THIS GAME:
   - After guesses, your number is revealed
   - The commitment hash matches the decrypted data
   - This proves you didn't cheat
